        <p> Welcome to H-Thai-ML, a Thai restaurant that has its roots from the countryside of Thailand. I traveled and stayed in some of the most rural areas of Thailand. The love of being in more obscure and quiet areas has increased my passion to embrace more traditional forms of cooking. Added with my years in the culinary arts, I found the blend I looked for all my life. I'm glad you're here to share this experience with me and hope you find similar goodness that I found years ago.</p>
